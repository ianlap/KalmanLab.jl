# types.jl - Additional type definitions and constructors for KalmanLab

# This file can be used for:
# - Custom constructors for KalmanFilter
# - Helper types for internal use
# - Type conversion utilities
# - Validation functions specific to types

# Currently all main types are defined in KalmanLab.jl
# This file is reserved for future type-related utilities
